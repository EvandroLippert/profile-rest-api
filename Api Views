What are API Views?

Allow us to define functions that match the standard HTTP methods:
    * Get - Retrieve item(s)
    * Post - Create item
    * Put - Update item
    * Delete - Delete item
    * Patch - Partially update item


The API View describes the logic to make API endpoint, then it gives us the most control over the logic

So, it's perfect for implenting complex logic

When to use API Views?

* Need full control over the logic;
* Processing files and rendering a synchronous response;
* You are calling other APIs/services;
* Accessing local files or data.
